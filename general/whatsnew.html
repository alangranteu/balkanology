I have updated the guidebook pages throughout the site to reflect the most recent available versions. The main changes in the last couple of years are ongoing updates to Bradt country guides, the expansion of Lonely Planet's "Western Balkans" to cover the whole of "Southeastern Europe", and the publication of a few new Cicerone walking guides covering Croatia and Slovenia.

Changes to the international rail timetable in December 2012 saw major cuts in international services in Croatia, Bosnia, and neighbouring countries. I've summarised the changes in a <a href="http://blog.balkanology.com/2013/01/cuts-to-international-rail-services-in.html">blog post</a>. It will take me some time to update the various references to train connections scattered through Balkanology, so some pages on the site may currently be out of date.
